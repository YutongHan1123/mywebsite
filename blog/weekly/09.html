          <p>As I mentioned before, I met tons of troubles I never imaged before. I overcame most of them, and some still need to do more work. I divided those troubles into three groups: scrape and clean the data, build the website, improve the website.</p>
          <br />

          <ul style="margin:0 10%;">
            <li>Scrape and Clean the Data
              <p>I spent nearly the whole of February to scrape and clean the data from the website Bilibili. And I met 3 problems:</p>
              <ol style="margin:0 10%;">
                <li>Scraping Chinese is different from English. I learn how to use library pandas to scrape Chinese.</li>
                <li>Because I’m in the US now, I can’t load the comments unless use VPN. So, I asked my friend in China to run the code on his computer.</li>
                <li>Another problem is I have no idea how to do n-gram in Python. Even though I watched some tutorials, it’s still so hard for me to understand. Fortunately, Deb recommended the book <em><a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/ngrams.html">Text Mining with R to me</a></em>. Do n-gram by R is much easier. In this way, I successfully found out the relationships between characters, and words.</li>
                <br />
              </ol>
              <img src="../../images/12/n-gram2.png" class="process" alt="">
              <p class="process">Clean and roughly visualize the data by R</p>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Build the Website
              <p>Then I focused on the visualization by d3 and website building during March. I tried different style charts, change the thickness of the line between bubbles, organize the context and charts.</p>
              <p>I tried to create bubbles by D3 after solving the n-gram problem. The challenge at this step is to create force among bubbles and change the stroke between them into different thicknesses. Because I created treemap charts by D3 last semester, I wasn’t stuck with the JSON file for a long time.</p>
              <p>I know my article will be very long, since there are seven book series, bullet screen comments and bottom comments will be visualized and analyzed. So, I need to organize my website very convenient for users to go through.</p>
              <img src="../../images/12/layout.png" class="process" alt="">
              <p class="process">Build the website, combine the charts and contents.</p>
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
<div class="projectprocess1" >
      <div class="leftsub">
        <div class="subt">
          <h2></h2>
        </div>

      </div>

      <div class="mainarticle">
        <p>Luckily I can focus on the visualization by d3 and website building now! I'm really happy. Even if I met some small troubles about D3,  I wasn’t stuck with them for a long time. D3 is much friendly than Python. Lenny told me Python is a friendly language, I doubt that now:(</p>
