          <p>This is a project I made with the help of <strong>D3.js</strong> during Data Viz course last semester.</p>
          <p>The project is about blue dye, telling you how indigo mirrored the decline and revival of China. Many Chinese workers relied on it for their livelihood last century. But their businesses was going up in flame. Because industrial indigo was successfully developed overseas. It is much cheaper than hand-made indigo. Soonly, Chinese workers lost their markets. At that time, they were also war-torn. What did they do? </p>
          <br>
          <p>It's my first time to tell a story about Chinese traditional culture. I have to say, it's a huge challenge for me. I read a lot of books to make sure the information in the article is correcr. I drew the gifs and background image, made the website more interactive, created mobile version. I met many bugs and finally, I overcame them. Luckily, with the help of professor Cairo and Lenny, I successfully finished the project.
